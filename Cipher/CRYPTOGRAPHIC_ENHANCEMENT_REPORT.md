## Technical Implementation Details

### Universal Cipher Pattern Compliance

All new implementations follow the established universal cipher pattern:

```javascript
(function(global) {
  'use strict';
  
  // Environment detection and dependency loading
  if (!global.OpCodes && typeof require !== 'undefined') {
    require('../../OpCodes.js');
  }
  
  const AlgorithmName = {
    internalName: 'unique-id',
    name: 'Display Name',
    testVectors: [...], // Comprehensive test vectors
    // Standard interface methods
  };
  
  // Auto-registration and export
})(typeof global !== 'undefined' ? global : window);
```

### OpCodes Library Integration

**Validation Results:** ✅ All enhanced algorithms successfully integrate OpCodes

**Key Functions Utilized:**
